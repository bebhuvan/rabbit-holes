# CMS Security Implementation

## Overview
The CMS page (`/cms`) is now protected with multiple layers of security to prevent unauthorized access while maintaining ease of use for legitimate users.

## Current Security Measures

### 1. Password Authentication
- **Client-side prompt**: Initial password challenge using JavaScript prompt
- **Server-side validation**: Password verification through `/auth` endpoint
- **Session management**: 24-hour session tokens stored in localStorage
- **Environment variable**: Password stored in `CMS_PASSWORD` environment variable

### 2. Session Management
- **Session tokens**: Base64-encoded random tokens
- **Expiration**: 24-hour automatic expiration
- **Storage**: localStorage with automatic cleanup
- **Validation**: Session checked on page load and API calls

### 3. Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents iframe embedding
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Browser XSS protection
- **Referrer-Policy**: Limits referrer information

### 4. Access Control
- **CORS configuration**: Controlled cross-origin requests
- **HTTP method restrictions**: Only POST allowed for auth
- **Automatic logout**: Session cleanup on logout
- **Redirect protection**: Unauthorized users redirected to home page

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Cloudflare Pages
1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Select your "rabbit-holes" project
3. Go to Settings > Environment variables
4. Add the following variables:
   - `CMS_PASSWORD`: Your secure password (e.g., "your-secure-password-2024")
   - `CLAUDE_API_KEY`: Your Claude API key

### 2. Deploy Changes
After setting environment variables, redeploy your site to apply the changes.

## Security Best Practices

### Password Requirements
- Use a strong, unique password (minimum 12 characters)
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Don't use common words or personal information
- Consider using a password manager

### Regular Maintenance
- Change the CMS password every 3-6 months
- Monitor access logs for unusual activity
- Update dependencies regularly

## Additional Security Options

### Enhanced Security (Optional)
For higher security requirements, consider:

1. **IP Whitelist**: Use Cloudflare WAF rules to restrict access by IP
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Implement TOTP-based 2FA
3. **Rate Limiting**: Limit login attempts per IP
4. **Separate Subdomain**: Move CMS to admin.yourdomain.com
5. **VPN Access**: Require VPN connection for CMS access

### Cloudflare WAF Rule Example
```
(http.request.uri.path eq "/cms" and ip.src ne YOUR_IP_ADDRESS)
```

## Monitoring

### Access Logs
Monitor Cloudflare logs for:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Multiple IPs accessing CMS
- Brute force attempts

### Security Alerts
Set up alerts for:
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Access from new IP addresses
- Unusual usage patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Password not working**: Check environment variable is set correctly
2. **Session expires quickly**: Check localStorage isn't being cleared
3. **Redirect loops**: Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. **Function not working**: Verify Cloudflare Functions are deployed

### Emergency Access
If locked out:
1. Update the password in Cloudflare environment variables
2. Clear browser localStorage
3. Redeploy the site
4. Try accessing with new password

## Security Checklist
