# ðŸŽ‰ Workers Migration Test

This is a test post to verify that our Cloudflare Pages to Workers migration is working correctly.

## What We're Testing

- âœ… **Pages deployment deleted** - No more dual deployments
- âœ… **Workers deployment active** - Only Workers should receive updates
- âœ… **PagesCMS workflow** - Changes should only affect Workers now
- âœ… **Manual deployment** - `wrangler deploy` should update Workers

## Migration Summary

We successfully:
1. **Migrated functions** from `/functions/` to `/src/api/`
2. **Created wrangler.toml** configuration
3. **Deployed to Workers** at https://rabbit-holes.r-bhuvanesh2007.workers.dev
4. **Deleted old Pages deployment** to prevent conflicts
5. **Fixed image overflow** issues in content areas

## Next Steps

After this test post is deployed to Workers:
- PagesCMS changes will only affect Workers
- Manual deployment required: `wrangler deploy`
- Future: Set up GitHub Actions for automatic Workers deployment
