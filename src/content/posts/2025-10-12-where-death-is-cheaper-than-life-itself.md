> Dying from adulterated or fake drugs is quite common in India. Only when you have a high number of cases from a single cluster does it catch the attention of the media or of the authorities. Otherwise, it is just another statistic of dying unnecessarily in India. Human life is cheap in India. Almost 70 years ago, the famous poet Sahir Ludhianvi wrote this about life in India:  
>   
> यहाँ इक खिलौना है इंसाँ की हस्ती  
> ये बस्ती है मुर्दा-परस्तों की बस्ती  
> यहाँ पर तो जीवन से है मौत सस्ती  
> ये दुनिया अगर मिल भी जाए तो क्या है  
>   
> Translation:  
>   
> Human dignity is worth a plaything here  
>   
> In this society that’s long lost its soul  
>   
> Where death is cheaper than life itself  
>   
> Every pursuit seems pointless here
