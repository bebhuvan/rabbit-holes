[François Chollet](https://x.com/fchollet/status/2019861668919152728?s=20) on the money here: 
> Whenever I hear Very Serious Businessmen make confident pronouncements about the future of AI, I remember what the very same people were saying in 2021 about the Metaverse and NFTs.
>
> When you lack a grounded, causal model of the world, your "predictions" are simply a remix of narratives you've heard from others.
> 
> Reminds me of something, actually

Good time to remember [Bhuvan's law](https://rabbitholes.garden/posts/2025-09-02-bhuvans-law/):
>     “Any discourse about artificial intelligence is indistinguishable from talking out of your ass.”
