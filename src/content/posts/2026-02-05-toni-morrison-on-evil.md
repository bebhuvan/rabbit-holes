> “I was always a little bored by demonstrations of evil.

> They relied on the same things. I used to say it always has this top hat and a cape and a tuxedo and a cane. And it has all this stuff. Glamour and costume. Maybe even a little theme music. But goodness never has anything, ‘cause it doesn't want anything. It can't use anything. It's just there.”
