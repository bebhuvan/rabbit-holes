[Lorin Hochstein responds](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2026/02/08/nobody-knows-how-the-whole-system-works/) to people who worey that AI "generates" code that we understand and itll probably lead to disasters down the line:
> Finally, Bucciarelli is right that systems like telephony are so inherently complex, have been built on top of so many different layers in so many different places, that no one person can ever actually understand how the whole thing works. This is the fundamental nature of complex technologies: our knowledge of these systems will always be partial, at best. Yes, AI will make this situation worse. But it’s a situation that we’ve been in for a long time.
