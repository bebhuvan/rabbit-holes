[Thinking about this passage](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/radical-fun?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5&triedRedirect=true):

> Everyone agrees that fun is good. Yet I’m sure we can all agree that most people do not seem to be having fun the majority of the time. This is because having fun, or at least having a balanced fun portfolio, is a skill. Most people tend to default to easy dopamine: scrolling Tiktok, online shopping, playing video games. Because they associate fun with guilt and a lack of productivity, they split their lives into two: “productive time” (hard, not fun) and “fun time” (semi-horizontal on the couch with barbecue chips and Love Island).  
>   
> What I want to advocate for is a life filled with different types of fun. Where you consistently have Type I, II, and III fun across the realms of relationships, work and hobbies.  
>   
> Now, if you are someone who is not currently having a great deal of fun in any area of your life, you might be thinking: That’s all well and good, but I haven’t the faintest clue of how to achieve that.  
>   
> That’s where friendship comes in.  
>   
> The truth is, connection is the heart of fun. And for most of us, friendship is our entrypoint into connection. Even if you don’t feel connected to your work and are struggling to find the right romantic partner, friendship is probably something that is accessible to you, if you approach it with a proactive strategy and open heart.
