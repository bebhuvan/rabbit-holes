[Interesting framing by Daniel Jefferies](https://x.com/i/status/2003726082261110934):

> Infinitely self recursively improving systems are impossible.  
>   
> It's impossible to make a system that can correct all its own mistakes when it is the very thing making the mistake in the first place.  
>   
> How do I know?  
>   
> Evolution hasn't figured it out in millions of years, why would we figure it out in two or two hundred?  
>   
> Your brain is a bunch of crude hacks. Wonderful hacks and amazing hacks but crude nonetheless.  
>   
> When you have to figure out if something is "true" or "real" you don't actually come to any concrete, real, objective truth most of the time.  
>   
> Instead, we have a ton of micro approximations in our heads that sorta, kinda get closer to an approximation of reality/truth, though sometimes they are way the hell off.
