It feels like off late all I am doing here is linking to Simon Willison, [but he's on the money here](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/#claude-as-a-general-agent):

> Claude Code is, with hindsight, poorly named. It’s not purely a coding tool: it’s a tool for general computer automation. Anything you can achieve by typing commands into a computer is something that can now be automated by Claude Code. It’s best described as a general agent. Skills make this a whole lot more obvious and explicit.  
>   
> I find the potential applications of this trick somewhat dizzying. Just thinking about this with my data journalism hat on: imagine a folder full of skills that covers tasks like the following:  
>   
> Where to get US census data from and how to understand its structure  
> How to load data from different formats into SQLite or DuckDB using appropriate Python libraries  
> How to publish data online, as Parquet files in S3 or pushed as tables to Datasette Cloud  
> A skill defined by an experienced data reporter talking about how best to find the interesting stories in a new set of data  
> 
> A skill that describes how to build clean, readable data visualizations using D3  
> Congratulations, you just built a “data journalism agent” that can discover and help publish stories against fresh drops of US census data. And you did it with a folder full of Markdown files and maybe a couple of example Python scripts.

Read his blog. It's awesome. Don't miss.
