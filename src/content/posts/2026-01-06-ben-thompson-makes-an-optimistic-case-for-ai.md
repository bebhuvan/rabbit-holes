[Ben Thompson makes an optimistic case for AI](https://stratechery.com/2026/ai-and-the-human-condition/):

> In fact, I have great optimism that one potential upside of AI is a renewed appreciation of and investment in beauty. One of the great tragedies of the industrial era — particularly today — is that beauty in our built environment is nowhere to be found. How is it that we built intricate cathedrals hundreds of years ago, and forgettable cookie-cutter crap today? That is, in fact, another labor story: before the industrial revolution labor was abundant and cheap, which meant it was defensible to devote thousands of person-years into intricate buildings; once labor was made more productive, and thus more valuable, it simply wasn’t financially viable to divert so much talent for so much time. Perhaps it follows, then, that the devaluing of labor Patel and Trammell warns about actually frees humans up to once again create beauty? Yes, robots could do it too, but I think humans will value the work of other humans more. Indeed, I think this is coming sooner than you might think: I expect the widespread availability of high quality AI art to actually make human art more desirable and valuable, precisely because of its provenance.

> It’s also worth noting the relative popularity of human-generated content versus AI-generated content. Sora is down to 59 in the App Store, and I count double-digit human-denominated social apps that rank above it. Yes, I get the argument that this is the worst that AI will ever be, but it also will never be human, which is what humans want most of all.
