I found this video helpful on how to use Obsidian with the Gemini CLI, but the same steps and logic apply to Claude Code as well. I’ve been using Obsidian with Claude Code, and my vault looks much more organized now.

I’m also experimenting with a new shortcut: I have a note called 'to claude' where I dump all sorts of information and instructions throughout the day. I then ask Claude to read that file to process and organize everything. I’ve also created a CLAUDE.md file with vault-specific instructions so I don’t have to keep repeating myself.

This is a pretty basic 'normie' setup, and while I keep seeing people on Twitter doing much more advanced stuff, this works perfectly for me. I also asked Claude Code if [https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills](https://) were useful and it figured out how to use them on its own.
