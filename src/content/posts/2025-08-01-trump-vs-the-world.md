Here we go: 

> President Trump unveiled a battery of new tariffs on Thursday targeting exports from dozens of U.S. trading partners, as he followed through with a disruptive plan to remake global trade.

Steep tariffs on more than 60 countries are set to snap into place at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 7, as the president realizes his vision for changing trade patterns he has long criticized as unfair and made central to his presidential campaign. Tariffs will range as high as 50 percent on some countries that the president has deemed to have unbalanced trade or that have not offered concessions to Washington in recent negotiations.
