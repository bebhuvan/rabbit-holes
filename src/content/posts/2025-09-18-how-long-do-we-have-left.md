Google DeepMind's Gemini and OpenAI achieved gold-medal-level performance at [the 2025 International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals](https://worldfinals.icpc.global/).

[OpenAI's Mostafa Rohaninejad:](https://x.com/MostafaRohani/status/1968360976379703569)

> We officially competed in the onsite AI track of the ICPC, with the same 5-hour time limit to solve all twelve problems, submitting to the ICPC World Finals Local Judge - judged identically and concurrently to the ICPC World Championship submissions. We received the problems in the exact same PDF form, and the reasoning system selected which answers to submit with no bespoke test-time harness whatsoever. For 11 of the 12 problems, the system’s first answer was correct. For the hardest problem, it succeeded on the 9th submission. Notably, the best human team achieved 11/12.

> An advanced version of [Gemini 2.5 Deep Think](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-deep-think/) has achieved gold-medal level performance at [the 2025 International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals](https://worldfinals.icpc.global/).
> 
> This milestone builds directly on Gemini 2.5 Deep Think's [gold-medal win at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/) just two months ago. Innovations from these efforts will continue to be integrated into future versions of Gemini Deep Think, expanding the frontier of advanced AI capabilities accessible to students and researchers.
> 
> Solving complex tasks at these competitions requires deep abstract reasoning, creativity, the ability to synthesize novel solutions to problems never seen before and a genuine spark of ingenuity.
> 
> Together, these breakthroughs in competitive programming and mathematical reasoning demonstrate Gemini’s profound leap in abstract problem-solving — marking a significant step on our path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).

> As a former competitive programmer, this gives me goosebumps and marks my Lee Sedol moment. Those days and nights spent grinding problems—starting in confusion and sweat, ending in excitement and a sense of accomplishment—can now be easily crushed by today’s language models. This is quite bittersweet, as I am now also cooking the very models that can beat humans in more and more domains. But life just moves on, as always. Models will keep getting smarter and more capable, and mankind in the 21st century will find new ways to live meaningful lives with these models.

I don't know _if I feel the AGI,_ but I feel _unemployment_ for sure.
