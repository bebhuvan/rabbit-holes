I don't know [if this](https://x.com/astraiaintel/status/2012469376616693949?s=20) is true:
> A Ukrainian AI-powered ground combat vehicle near Lyman refused to abandon its forward defensive position and continued engaging enemy forces, despite receiving multiple orders to return to its company in order to preserve its hardware.
> 
> The UGV reportedly neutralized more than 30 Russian soldiers before it was ultimately destroyed.
> 
> While the Russian detachment was pinned down, Ukrainian infantry exploited the opportunity and cleared two contested fields of enemy presence, successfully re-establishing control over the area. 
> 
> These events took place during the final week of December 2025.
