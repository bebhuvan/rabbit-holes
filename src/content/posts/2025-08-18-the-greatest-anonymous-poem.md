I heard about the poem _“Tom o’ Bedlam”_ in an [interview with Harold Bloom](https://www.rabbitholes.garden/posts/2025-08-17-why-read). He called it _“the greatest anonymous lyric poem in English,”_ and he’s not wrong. I’ve reread it multiple times, and what stands out is its steadily increasing intensity, culminating in that stunning crescendo at the end. The poem is written in Early Modern English, so I asked Gemini to explain it to me line by line.

> “Tom o’ Bedlam” is a haunting and powerful anonymous English folk ballad from the 17th century. It’s sung from the perspective of a “Tom o’ Bedlam,” a licensed beggar who was formerly an inmate of the Bethlehem Royal Hospital (Bedlam), a notorious mental asylum in London. These former patients were given a special license to beg for food and money, often carrying a distinctive horn to identify themselves. The poem is a mix of fantastical rants, social commentary, and a deep-seated sadness.

> 
> From the hag and hungry goblin  
> That into rags would rend ye,  
> The spirit that stands by the naked man  
> In the Book of Moons defend ye,  
> That of your five sound senses  
> You never be forsaken,  
> Nor wander from yourselves with Tom  
> Abroad to beg your bacon.  
> While I do sing,  
> Any food, any feeding,  
> Feeding, drink, or clothing;  
> Come dame or maid, be not afraid,  
> Poor Tom will injure nothing.
> 
> Of thirty bare years have I  
> Twice twenty been enragèd,  
> And of forty been three times fifteen  
> In durance soundly cagèd.  
> On the lordly lofts of Bedlam,  
> With stubble soft and dainty,  
> Brave bracelets strong, sweet whips ding-dong,  
> With wholesome hunger plenty.  
> And now I sing,  
> Any food, any feeding,  
> Feeding, drink, or clothing;  
> Come dame or maid, be not afraid,  
> Poor Tom will injure nothing.
> 
> With a thought I took for Maudlin,  
> And a cruse of cockle pottage,  
> With a thing thus tall, sky bless you all,  
> I fell into this dotage.  
> I slept not since the Conquest,  
> Till then I never wakèd,  
> Till the roguish boy of love, where I lay,  
> Me found and stript me naked.  
> And now I sing,  
> Any food, any feeding,  
> Feeding, drink, or clothing;  
> Come dame or maid, be not afraid,  
> Poor Tom will injure nothing.
> 
> When I short have shorn my sow’s face  
> And swigged my horny barrel,  
> In an oaken inn I pound my skin  
> As a suit of gilt apparel;  
> The moon’s my constant mistress,  
> And the lowly owl my marrow;  
> The flaming drake and the night crow make  
> Me music to my sorrow.  
> While I do sing,  
> Any food, any feeding,  
> Feeding, drink, or clothing;  
> Come dame or maid, be not afraid,  
> Poor Tom will injure nothing.
> 
> The palsy plagues my pulses  
> When I prig your pigs or pullen,  
> Your culvers take, or matchless make  
> Your Chanticleer or Sullen.  
> When I want provant with Humphrey  
> I sup, and when benighted,  
> I repose in Paul’s with waking souls  
> Yet never am affrighted.  
> But I do sing,  
> Any food, any feeding,  
> Feeding, drink, or clothing;  
> Come dame or maid, be not afraid,  
> Poor Tom will injure nothing.
> 
> I know more than Apollo,  
> For oft, when he lies sleeping,  
> I see the stars at bloody wars  
> In the wounded welkin weeping;  
> The moon embrace her shepherd,  
> And the Queen of Love her warrior,  
> While the first doth horn the Star of Morn,  
> And the next the heavenly Farrier.  
> And I do sing,  
> Any food, any feeding,  
> Feeding, drink, or clothing;  
> Come dame or maid, be not afraid,  
> Poor Tom will injure nothing.
> 
> The Gipsy Snap and Pedro  
> Are none of Tom’s companions,  
> The punk I scorn, and the cutpurse sworn,  
> And the roaring boy’s bravadoes.  
> The meek, the white, the gentle,  
> Me handle, touch, and spare not,  
> But those that cross Tom Rynosseros  
> Do what the panther dare not.  
> With a host of furious fancies  
> Whereof I am commander,  
> With a burning spear and a horse of air,  
> To the wilderness I wander.  
> By a knight of ghosts and shadows  
> I summoned am to tourney.  
> Ten leagues beyond the wild world’s end,  
> Methinks it is no journey.  
> Yet will I sing,  
> Any food, any feeding,  
> Feeding, drink, or clothing;  
> Come dame or maid, be not afraid,  
> Poor Tom will injure nothing.
