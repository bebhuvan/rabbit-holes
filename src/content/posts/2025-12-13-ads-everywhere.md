[Ads are coming to AI platforms one way or another.](https://open.substack.com/pub/aiadeconomy/p/here-comes-ai-media?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5)

I agree.

> Here’s what I think will happen in 2026:  
>   
> AI platforms will start offering paid placement within conversations where clear purchase intent signals are evident.  
>   
> The ads will be clearly labeled as sponsored, and they will likely tie into direct purchase opportunities.  
>   
> Eventually, ads will also appear embedded in other types of interactions, such as inspiration (where should I take my family on spring break?) and research (what are the best resorts near Disney World?), effectively turning AI chats into a new media channel.
