The ease with which Maria Popova [strings together words](https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/12/the-coziest-place-on-the-moon/) of lyrical rhythm and immense depth is striking.

> I thought of Einstein, who at sixteen, lonely and introverted, began wondering about the nature of the universe by imagining himself chasing a beam of light through outer space; I thought of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, also lonely and also dedicated to the light, who at the same time was formulating his general theory of love as [“two solitudes that protect, border, and greet each other.”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/29/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-macy-barrows/) And I thought about how love is simply the solitary light between people, neither partitioned nor merged but shared, to light up the sliver of spacetime we have each been allotted before returning our borrowed stardust to the universe.
