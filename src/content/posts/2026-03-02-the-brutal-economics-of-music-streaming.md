I don't know enough about the music industry to know [if this piece is true](https://joelgouveia.substack.com/p/the-death-of-spotify-why-streaming?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5&triedRedirect=true), but if it's true, then it's depressing.

> In a normal tech business (like SaaS or Netflix), as you gain more subscribers, your profit margins increase exponentially because your fixed costs stay relatively stable. Once Netflix pays $20 million to produce an original movie, that cost is fixed. Whether 1 million or 100 million people watch it, the cost doesn’t change. The margin expands.
> 
Streaming music operates in reverse. Because DSPs pay out roughly 70% of every dollar earned back to rightsholders (labels and publishers), their costs scale linearly with their user base. Every time a song is streamed, a fraction of a cent leaves the building.

Iovine put it bluntly: “The streaming services have a bad situation, there’s no margins, they’re not making any money.”
> 
> This model only works for Apple, Amazon, and Google, because they don’t need their music platforms to be wildly profitable. Amazon uses music as a loss-leader to keep you paying for Prime. Apple uses it to sell $1,000 iPhones.
