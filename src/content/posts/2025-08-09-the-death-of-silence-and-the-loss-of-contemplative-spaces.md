A morning coffee on the terrace becomes a meditation on what we've lost: the quiet spaces that allow us to think, dream, and become fully human. From Bangalore's traffic-choked streets to LEGO-block cities that strip away wonder, this is a manifesto for defending the contemplative spaces essential to human flourishing. Why asking for silence has become a revolutionary act, and what it means for our children who may never know what it's like to walk in peace.
