[This is good financial advice from Ross Barkan](https://rosselliotbarkan.com/p/the-matter-of-money?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5&triedRedirect=true):

> One complication of the n+1 listing is not so much the salary itself but the sheer number of responsibilities. A managing editor must oversee all three print issues, supervise fact-checking and proofreading, serve as “product manager” for n+1 Books, plan and execute magazine events and fundraisers, read submissions and respond to pitches, hire interns, and “assist with the management of n+1 programming and day-to-day operational tasks.” That’s a great deal of work. A low stress office job with a remote option at $60,000 isn’t a bad deal at all. This is management, editing and business alike, and I’d argue for the responsibilities required, a higher salary is in order. This is where the Atlantic writer has her point to make. But she should also, as they used to say in the 2010s, check her privilege. It’s why, as a general rule, I don’t publicly comment on other people’s salaries or job listings. I know I am privileged. My assumption is this writer is not one of those Atlantic superstars clearing $200,000 or $300,000—I don’t know her writing very well—but I would make a strong guess she’s earning into the low six-figures, given her revulsion at the n+1 listing. There may come a time, given the chaos of media life, she comes begging for such a post one day. There may come a time when I am begging for it too. Who can know, really, what the future holds. My philosophy has always been to [hustle hard](https://rosselliotbarkan.com/p/generation-hustle), have fun, and earn as much as I possibly can. You never know when the carousel stops spinning.
