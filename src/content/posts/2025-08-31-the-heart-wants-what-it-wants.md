I learned that the famous line "The heart wants what it wants" is from a famous letter by Emily Dickinson and not Woody Allen.

The full line:

> Dear Mary -
> 
> When the Best is gone - I know that other things are not of consequence - The Heart wants what it wants - or else it does not care -
> 
> You wonder why I write - so - Because I cannot help - I like to have you know some care - so when your life gets faint for itâ€™s other life - you can lean on us - We wont break, Mary. We look very small - but the Reed can carry weight.
