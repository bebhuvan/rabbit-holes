No matter how much you read about China, it's still hard to wrap your head around the fact that they're [dominant across so many different industries](https://www.ft.com/content/785103f1-1151-45c7-9867-ee65433c29c4). It's even crazier that Western companies are being forced to go hat in hand begging for their technology. What a stunning reversal of fortunes. It was China that was doing the begging when it was starting its development journey.

> This is not just happening in the automotive industry. In biotech, western pharmaceutical companies are signing billions of dollars in licensing deals to access intellectual property from Chinese drugmakers, reaching $41.5bn in 2024. In robotics, American start-ups are building with Chinese hardware platforms, such as Unitree’s nimble G1 humanoid robot. In AI, Chinese open-source models such as Alibaba’s Qwen series are being used by developers in the US.

> Meta’s recent acquisition of agentic AI start-up Manus offers a striking case study. At the end of 2025, Meta announced it was buying Manus in a deal reportedly valued at more than $2bn, delivering a windfall for the start-up’s early Chinese investors such as Tencent and HSG. In an intensifying AI race, one of America’s biggest tech companies turned to a start-up founded in China in order to gain an edge.
