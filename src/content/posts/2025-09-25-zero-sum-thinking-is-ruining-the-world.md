This [tweet thread](https://x.com/EconomPic/status/1971031520862523831) by Jake resonated deeply with me. We all seem to be becoming increasingly adversarial in how we think about the world, and that's not a good thing:

> The deepest divide in today's world, whether in economics, politics, investing, or even religion, seems to come down to those who view society as a zero-sum game and those who believe in shared growth. This is increasingly showing up everywhere, from relatively benign issues like tariffs and tax policy to more consequential debates over social rights and aid (and even territorial ambitions). Decisions being made seem shaped by a mindset that there needs to be a winner and loser over collective progressâ€¦ at the expense of longstanding norms and values.

And

> If you see the world as zero sum, you end up resenting people who are different from you or who enter your space (whether in the economy, schools, or country) because you view them as an opponent and their presence as a direct cost to yourself.
