[This is a big part of my philosophy of money](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2011/06/06/why-you-need-f-you-money/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email). As obvious as it may seem, most people don't frame the necessity of money in their heads in this way. 
> There are many things money can buy, but the most valuable of all is freedom. Freedom to do what you want and work for whom you respect.
> 
> Those who live paycheck to paycheck are slaves. Those who carry debt are slaves with even stouter shackles. Don’t think for the moment their masters don’t know it.
> 
> Chains

> I first accumulated the modest amount I needed around 1989. Not enough to retire on perhaps, but enough to say F-you if needed.

This reminds of this clip I once saw in twitter:
> Jim Bennett: I've been up two and a half million dollars.
> Frank: What you got on you?
> 
> Jim Bennett: Nothing.
> 
> Frank: What you put away?
> 
> Jim Bennett: Nothing.
> 
> Frank: You get up two and a half million dollars, any asshole in the world knows what to do: you get a house with a 25 year roof, an indestructible Jap-economy shitbox, you put the rest into the system at three to five percent to pay your taxes and that's your base, get me? That's your fortress of fucking solitude. That puts you, for the rest of your life, at a level of fuck you. Somebody wants you to do something, fuck you. Boss pisses you off, fuck you! Own your house. Have a couple bucks in the bank. Don't drink. That's all I have to say to anybody on any social level. Did your grandfather take risks?
> Jim Bennett: Yes.
> 
> Frank: I guarantee he did it from a position of fuck you. A wise man's life is based around fuck you. The United States of America is based on fuck you. You're a king? You have an army? Greatest navy in the history of the world? Fuck you! Blow me. We'll fuck it up ourselves.
