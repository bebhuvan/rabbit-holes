Rachel Christine on [whether books can teach you anything](https://x.com/RachelXReads/status/2013343292600033708?s=20): 
> This is perhaps tangential, but I think the "books can't teach you anything" argument comes from the accurate observation that most *modern novels* honestly can't teach you anything. Classic literature was consumed with the struggle between good and evil; it obsessed over the question of humanity and its greater purpose; it scrutinized what it means to find true happiness. It was philosophy wrapped in the glory of a very human story. George Eliot knew that. Many modern writers do not. I know some who do, but they're bound by the market and feel forced to write what sells. It's time to repopularize excellent literature.
