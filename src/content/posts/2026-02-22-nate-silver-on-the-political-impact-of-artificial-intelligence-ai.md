[Agree with everything Nate Silver is saying](https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-singularity-wont-be-gentle) in this post about the cluelessness and idiocy of both Silicon Valley and politicians about the potential fallout of AI if it indeed is a big deal: 
> Disruption to the “creative classes” could produce an outsized political impact. I’m not exactly sure where people in the creative classes — say, writers or editors or artists [6]  or, to broaden the net, industries like consulting or advertising — rank in terms of the medium-term threat from AI-related job displacement. (Journalists per se have long lived with an anvil over their heads in a perpetually struggling industry.) These are the people I tend to hang out with. In our darker moods, we sometimes have conversations about who will or won’t have a job in five years. I suspect they’re at above-average risk, though — less threatened than, say, mediocre programmers but more than, say, someone with irreplaceable physical gifts like Victor Wembanyama. However cynical one is about the failings of the “expert” class, these are people who tend to shape public opinion and devote a lot of time and energy to politics. If a consensus develops among this cohort that their livelihoods are threatened, or that their children’s livelihoods are, I expect there will be enough political blowback that anti-elite pushback won’t be enough to overcome it.
