I've been messing around with AI coding tools lately, and they're so good that even someone who can't code (me) can build actual websites. While building [Paper Lanterns](https://paperlanterns.ink/) to collect public domain letters and essays, I stumbled across Seneca's letters to Lucilius. First read? Meh. Thought it was just another ancient Roman philosopher trying to sound profound. But when I came back to them a few weeks later and actually paid attention, I was floored. These 2,000-year-old letters about how to live a good life are ridiculously relevant—covering everything from managing time and emotions to dealing with death and maintaining friendships.

The letters are freely available on WikiSource, but reading them there wasn't great so I built [Seneca.ink](http://Seneca.ink)—a simple, clean site where you can actually enjoy reading these letters without the clunky interface getting in the way. If you're curious about Stoicism but don't want to wade through academic texts or listen to LinkedIn influencers bastardize it into "productivity hacks," these letters are the perfect starting point.
