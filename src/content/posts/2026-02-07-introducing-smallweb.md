[Small web](https://smallweb.blog/) started with a simple idea: build an aggregator for indie blogs and newsletters—a small corner of the web where you can discover personal writing and fall down interesting rabbit holes.

I think the initial spark came while reading about content slop online. I wanted to create an antidote to that—a place showcasing real people writing real things.
With Claude Code, the backend came together in under an hour. I spent more time on the design, and what you see now is the result: a simple RSS aggregator that pulls from blogs and newsletters three times a day.

The selection criteria? Every single blog here is one I've read at least a post or two from over the years. No filler, no algorithmic suggestions—just an eclectic collection across various topics that I actually follow. I don't necessarily agree with everything, but they're all worth reading.

These days, I start most mornings here looking for my daily reads, and I'm often rewarded with wonderful discoveries.

I hope you find your next favorite read here too. Happy rabbit-holing. Please do share it with your peoples.
