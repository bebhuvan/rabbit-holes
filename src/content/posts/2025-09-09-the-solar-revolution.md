> Hot take: Solar “scaling laws” will ultimately prove more impactful on humanity than the AI version

I agree.

Cheap solar is, in my humble view, one of the most underappreciated innovations in the recent past. I think it will prove to more consequential to humanity than most people assume.

While there is a loud debate about [overcapacity](https://www.ft.com/content/debdb94a-822d-4115-b45f-5623d9f9c7a2) among Chinese solar panel manufacturers, I think it's a good problem to have. Look the spectacular increase in the import of Chinese solar panels by African countries. I'm pretty sure all these countries would love more overcapacity and, by extension, cheap prices.

China is the best thing to have happened to the green transition. There is no green transition without China!
