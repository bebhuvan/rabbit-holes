Reminds me of something I've heard [Jim O’Shaughnessy say often](https://mastersinvest.com/humannaturequotes):

> “At the centre of all market pricing are **human** beings. I joke the Four Horseman of the investment apocalypse are fear, greed, hope and ignorance, only one of which is not an emotion. Fear, greed and hope have wiped out more money than any market downturn. Because of all the foibles of **human nature** that are well documented by behavioural research – and now by neuroloigical research – people are always going to overshoot and undershoot when pricing securities. A review of financial markets all the way back to the South Sea company proves this out. As long as **human nature** doesn’t fundamentally change, we can continue to arbitrage the pricing inefficiencies it creates.”
