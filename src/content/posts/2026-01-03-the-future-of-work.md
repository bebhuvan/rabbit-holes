I think the future [Erik Brynjolfsson is describing](https://time.com/7342494/ai-changed-work-forever/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_content=020126) is highly probable:

> Future historians will see that the seeds of a profound transformation were planted in 2025. By 2050, most people will command workforces larger than the biggest multinational corporations of today. But our “employees” won’t be people sitting in cubicles or standing on factory floors. They will be fleets of AI agents—digital workers which can perform tasks like design products, write code, negotiate supply chains, run complex experiments, and devise marketing campaigns while we sleep.

> Consequently, in this new world, many workers will become what I call Chief Question Officers (CQO).  
> In the coming years, a CQO’s primary job will be to possess the judgment to know what to ask, why it matters, and how to evaluate if the AI has actually succeeded. We will be the architects; the AI will be the builders.
