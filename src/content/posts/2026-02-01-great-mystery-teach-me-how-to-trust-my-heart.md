The awesome Frederik Gieschen shared this [wonderful prayer](https://substack.com/@frederikgieschen/note/c-207252245?r=1eft5) on Substack:

> Wakan Tanka, Great Mystery,  
> teach me how to trust  
> my heart,  
> my mind,  
> my intuition,  
> my inner knowing,  
> the senses of my body,  
> the blessings of my spirit.  
> Teach me to trust these things  
> so that I may enter my Sacred Space  
> and love beyond my fear,  
> and thus Walk in Balance  
> with the passing of each glorious Sun.

> According to certain tribes, the Sacred Space is between the exhalation and inhalation of the breath. To Walk in Balance is to have Heaven (spirituality) and Earth (physicality) in Harmony.”
