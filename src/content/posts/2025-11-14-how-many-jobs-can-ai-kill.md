> I'm confident that AI is not going to wipe out anywhere close to 25M jobs **on net** over the next decade. If technological shocks caused **net, long-run** displacement, employment in the US would be 0. Instead, it's among its highest peacetime age-adjusted levels. But... 1/2
> 
> ...AI could absolutely drive **gross displacement**; think of automobiles displacing horse-related jobs even as they created new types of auto manufacturing & services jobs. That's painful for workers, especially in the short-run & especially for workers in jobs more automatable.
> 
> Important to note however that even the amount of **gross displacement** from AI is highly uncertain; most of its use cases so far augment some tasks rather than replacing entire jobs.
