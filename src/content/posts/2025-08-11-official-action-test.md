# ðŸš€ Official Action Test

This test uses the official `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3` with proper authentication.

## What's Different

- âœ… **Official Cloudflare Action** instead of manual wrangler
- âœ… **Account ID** provided for better authentication
- âœ… **API Token** with all required permissions
- âœ… **Better error handling** and reliability

## Expected Result

When this post is committed:
1. **GitHub Actions** uses the official Cloudflare action
2. **Authentication** should work properly
3. **Deployment** to Workers should succeed
4. **No more** authentication errors

## Migration Status

- âœ… **Pages deployment deleted**
- âœ… **Workers configuration complete**
- âœ… **Functions migrated** to `/src/api/`
- âœ… **Official Wrangler Action** configured
- âœ… **API token** with correct permissions
- âœ… **Account ID** added to secrets
- âœ… **Automatic deployment** ready

## Final Test

If this works, the migration will be **100% complete** and you'll have:
- âœ… **Automatic deployment** when PagesCMS pushes changes
- âœ… **Reliable authentication** with official action
- âœ… **Same workflow** as Pages had before

**Let's see if the official action works!** ðŸŽ‰
