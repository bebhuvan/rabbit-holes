AI might be a bubble, but the smart people are using these tools to extract value. My personal take: whether AI is a bubble or not matters to the investors betting on it. The rest of us normies should shut the fuck up and abuse the VC subsidy that's making these awesome tools accessible for so cheapest.

[I'm saying this based on findings from a survey conducted by Lenny Rachitsky and others](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/ai-tools-are-overdelivering-results):

> tl;dr: AI is overdelivering.  
>   
> 55% of respondents say AI has exceeded their expectations, and almost 70% say it’s improved the quality of their work.  
>   
> More than half of respondents said AI is saving them at least half a day per week on their most important tasks. We’ve never seen a tool deliver a productivity boost like this before.  
>   
> Founders are getting the most out of AI. Half (49%) report that AI saves them over 6 hours per week, dramatically higher than for any other role. Close to half (45%) also feel that the quality of their work is “much better” thanks to AI.  
>   
> Designers are seeing the fewest benefits. Only 45% report a positive ROI (compared with 78% of founders), and 31% report that AI has fallen below expectations, triple the rate among founders.  
>   
> Engineers have accepted AI as a coding partner and now want it to handle the more boring (but necessary) work of building products: documentation, code review, and writing tests.  
>   
> n8n is currently dominating the agent landscape, though actual adoption of agentic platforms in 2025 has been slow.  
>   
> A whopping 92.4% of respondents report at least one significant downsides to using AI tools. There’s definitely room for improvement.
