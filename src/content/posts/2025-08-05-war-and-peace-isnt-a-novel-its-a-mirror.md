Reflections from 500 Pages into *War and Peace*

At the beginning of this year, I started reading *War and Peace* thanks to [this post](https://footnotesandtangents.substack.com/p/welcome-to-war-and-peace-2025). This is my first proper literary classic, and I was intimidated—it’s a massive 1300-page novel. At that size, it’s more of a doorstopper, a blunt-force murder weapon, a budget-friendly bullet shield, or an effective paperweight—certainly less of a “novel” and more of a commitment.

I was also anxious that it would be too dense for my feeble brain. I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Contrary to public perception, the novel is easy to read, enjoyable, and gripping. The best way I can describe it is as *the most searing and brutal portrait of life*. Because of the novel’s length, the characters are deeply fleshed out, and their psychological insides are laid bare. Tolstoy subjects them to the full spectrum of the human experience—love, loss, grief, doubt, gluttony, boredom, epiphany, and assorted existential crises.

Before I began, I came across a review—I forget where—that said the book is filled with philosophical digressions, and they were “annoying.” That stuck with me, probably because I had just started exploring philosophy myself. But after reading 500 pages, I can confidently say that these reflections—on love, faith, duty, honor, the meaning of life—are my favorite part. They’re dense, nuanced, and quietly brilliant.

One of the most underappreciated aspects of the novel is how it forces you to interrogate your own philosophy of life.

Here's on such philosophical reflection.

From **Book Six: 1808–10, Chapter I**:

> “How pleasant it is, your excellency!” he said with a respectful smile.
> 
> “What?”
> 
> “It’s pleasant, your excellency!”
> 
> “What is he talking about?” thought Prince Andrew. “Oh, the spring, I suppose,” he thought as he turned round. “Yes, really everything is green already... How early! The birches and cherry and alders too are coming out... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is one oak!”
> 
> At the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a man could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred. With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged, stern, and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak, refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine.
> 
> “Spring, love, happiness!” this oak seemed to say. “Are you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the same and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look at those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too, sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown, whether from my back or my sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in your hopes and your lies.”
> 
> As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak, too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid, misshapen, and grim as ever.
> 
> “Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,” thought Prince Andrew. “Let others—the young—yield afresh to that fraud, but we know life, our life is finished!”
> 
> A whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully pleasant, rose in his soul in connection with that tree. During this journey he, as it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion, restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything anew—but that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and not disturbing himself or desiring anything.

From **Chapter III**:

> Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not waiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.
> 
> It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood around, were delicately green with fluffy young shoots.
> 
> The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in the shade, the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales trilled, and their voices reverberated now near, now far away.
> 
> “Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,” thought Prince Andrew. “But where is it?” he again wondered, gazing at the left side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured, spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now. Through the hard century-old bark, even where there were no twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced.
> 
> “Yes, it is the same oak,” thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal. All the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory. Austerlitz with the lofty heavens, his wife’s dead reproachful face, Pierre at the ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that night itself and the moon, and... all this rushed suddenly to his mind.
> 
> “No, life is not over at thirty-one!” Prince Andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively. “It is not enough for me to know what I have in me—everyone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it, but so that it may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!”
