There's something profoundly liberating about turning off notifications. Not just muting them, but actually disabling the constant stream of interruptions that have become the default mode of modern digital life.

I've been experimenting with what Cal Newport calls "digital minimalism" – the philosophy of being more selective about the technologies we allow into our lives. The core idea isn't to reject technology entirely, but to be more intentional about how and why we use it.

The most interesting discovery? It's not about the time we spend on devices, but about the quality of attention we can maintain when those devices aren't constantly pulling us in different directions.

Consider this: when was the last time you had a sustained, uninterrupted thought? Not just a few minutes of focus, but the kind of deep contemplation that leads to genuine insight? For most of us, it's been longer than we'd like to admit.

The problem isn't that technology is inherently bad. It's that we've optimized our digital environments for engagement rather than for the kind of thinking that actually matters. Every app is designed to capture and hold our attention, creating what researcher Matthew Crawford calls "a crisis of attention."

But here's what's fascinating – when you start being more selective about your digital inputs, you don't just get more time. You get better thinking. Ideas have space to develop. Connections between concepts become clearer. The quality of your mental life improves dramatically.

This isn't about becoming a digital hermit. It's about recognizing that our attention is finite and precious, and that we should be as careful with it as we are with our money or our health.

Maybe the real question isn't whether we're spending too much time with technology, but whether we're spending enough time without it.
