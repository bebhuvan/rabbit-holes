[Charles Jones and Christopher Tonetti on AI and automation](https://x.com/i/status/2011884710319047135):

> Summary by Claude.
> 
> Let me break down what Jones and Tonetti are arguing.
> 
> The Core Question
> 
> How much of past economic growth came from automation, and what does that tell us about AI's future impact?
> 
> The Key Insight: "Weak Links"
> 
> The paper's central concept is that economic production involves complementary tasks — you need all of them to produce output. Think of it like a chain: your output is limited by your weakest link, not your strongest.
> 
> This has a counterintuitive implication: even if you automate 95% of tasks with infinite productivity, you don't get infinite output. You're still constrained by that remaining 5%.
> 
> What They Found Historically
> 
> 1\. Machines improve faster than humans  
> The growth rate of capital productivity (how good machines are at tasks) exceeds labor productivity by at least 5 percentage points per year across all sectors they studied.
> 
> 2\. Automation's real benefit  
> The gain from automation isn't the act of switching itself — when you automate a task, you do it at the point where capital and labor costs are equal, so there's no immediate productivity jump.  
> The real gain is that once automated, that task now benefits from rapidly-improving machines rather than slowly-improving humans.
> 
> 3\. Automation explains most historical growth  
> If you "froze" automation at 1950 levels — keeping all subsequent improvements in machine and labor productivity but not automating any new tasks — you'd lose essentially all TFP growth in the private business sector.
> 
> What This Means for AI
> 
> Here's where it gets provocative:  
> Growth will accelerate — their model predicts growth rates rising to 5%+ annually over the next 75 years.  
> But the acceleration is remarkably slow:  
>   
> By 2040: GDP only 4% higher than trend  
> By 2060: GDP only 19% higher than trend  
>   
> Why so slow?
> 
> Weak links again. Even as AI automates more cognitive tasks, the economy remains constrained by whatever tasks humans still perform.  
> The software example is striking: Software is ~2% of GDP. Automating all software tasks with infinite productivity would raise GDP by... about 2%. Weak links mean you can't escape the constraint of everything else.
> 
> Three Possible Futures
> 
> They model three scenarios based on whether all tasks eventually get automated:  
>   
> Full automation (capital share → 100%): Explosive growth, infinite income in finite time
> 
> Permanent weak links (some tasks never automated): Growth eventually slows to the rate humans improve (~0.5%/year)
> 
> Asymptotic automation (labor share → 0 but never reaches it): Growth still explodes, but the capital share stays stable  
>   
> The remarkable finding: all three paths look nearly identical for the next 75 years. The differences only emerge in the distant future.  
> Important Caveats  
> The authors are refreshingly honest about limitations:  
>   
> "The key 'weak link' in our results so far is the use of ChatGPT to estimate the automation rate"  
>   
> They literally used an LLM to estimate what fraction of tasks have been automated in each sector over time — and acknowledge this needs refinement.  
> The Big Picture
> 
> This paper pushes back against both AI hype and AI dismissiveness:  
>   
> Against hype: Even with rapid AI progress, weak links mean growth acceleration is slow. No singularity next decade.
> 
> Against dismissiveness: Automation has been the primary driver of historical growth. AI continues this trend.  
>   
> The framework is elegant: growth happens because we keep shifting tasks from slowly-improving humans to rapidly-improving machines. AI is just the latest chapter in a centuries-old story.  
>   
> What aspects would you like me to dig deeper into? The math behind weak links, their empirical methodology, or the future simulations?
