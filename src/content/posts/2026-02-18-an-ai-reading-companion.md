Having an AI assistant while reading has been really helpful. It's like having a person who knows a lot about a lot of things at your beck and call. Considering the fact that LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude are pretty much trained on all the written knowledge of humanity available on the internet, they make for excellent teachers. So I built this simple eBook reader with an AI integration.

You can upload an eBook, and if you are having trouble understanding anything, you can invoke an LLM of your choice and then ask questions. All you have to do is set an API key using \[Openrouter\]([https://openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)) or your LLM of choice.
