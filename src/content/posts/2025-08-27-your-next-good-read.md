I built [Paper Trails](https://papertrails.rabbitholes.garden/digests/) to aggregate RSS feeds from some of the blogs and newsletters I enjoy reading. It's become a wonderful place for me to find new rabbit holes 🐰 🕳️ and you may too. Check it out and let me know if you have any suggestions.

I add a possibly dumb yet genius new feature called "[Random Digest](https://papertrails.rabbitholes.garden/digests/)." Twice a week, the site automatically pulls 10 links randomly from different categories and creates a digest in case you want to randomly read something.

What do you think?

I don't care why you think.

But if would love to know.

I don't care.

Tell me please 🥺
