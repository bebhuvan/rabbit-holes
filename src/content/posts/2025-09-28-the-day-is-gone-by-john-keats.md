Beautiful poem.

> The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!  
> Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast,  
> Warm breath, light whisper, tender semi-tone,  
> Bright eyes, accomplish'd shape, and lang'rous waist!  
> Faded the flower and all its budded charms,  
> Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,  
> Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,  
> Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise—  
> Vanished unseasonably at shut of eve,  
> When the dusk holiday—or holinight  
> Of fragrant-curtain'd love begins to weave  
> The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight;  
> But, as I've read love's missal through to-day,  
> He'll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray.
