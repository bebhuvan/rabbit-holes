What if [this version of "business as usual"](https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1987832991482106113?t=39SQNT5npYbgH6wM7L_zEQ&s=19) reality comes true. Seems like a good frame to have in your mental toolbox when thinking about the future path of AI.

> in a post-AGI world, people will simply get used to the fact that computers can solve cognitive problems quickly, and beat us in any cognitive domain, just like we're used to computers multiplying large numbers quickly now, or kicking our asses in chess and go. software and math will lose all their scarcity.

> once computers are doing it, that won't be a thing anymore. theorem proving will be as trivial as multiplying large numbers. the "uh duh but godel?" folk will still be confused. and computers will come up with incredibly simple, clean Lean proofs for impossibly hard problems. and mathematicians will yell that it is just some trick to satisfy the checker, that it isn't real math if we can't understand it. but then we'll ask the AI and it will kindly reveal the nature of a surprisingly clever mathematical structure that is so alien for our brains to come up with
