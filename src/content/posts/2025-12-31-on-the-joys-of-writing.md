[Wonderful reflection on the rewards of writing by Victor Kumar](https://openquestionsblog.substack.com/p/how-it-started-vs-how-its-going?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&shareImageVariant=overlay&r=1eft5&triedRedirect=true). The post is filled with other rabbit holes including links to Victor's writing and also other philosophers writing on Substack. My kinda post 😺

> What I didn’t realize was that writing a Substack would also reignite my intellect. Over the first five months, I posted an essay nearly every week. I’ve always read a lot, but before, the words passed through me—my mind a sieve. Now, I keep dozens of running files in my notes app about topics I hope to write about. Before, spare moments were taken up by mindless scrolling. Now, they’re spent writing and editing. Substack brought my mind back to life. I gained autonomy over my work instead of being yoked to journal referees or newspaper editors. My essays here have less professional currency than journal articles, less reach than op-eds, but they’re more meaningful to me. (I’d give it all up for a byline in The New Yorker.)
