I can't believe I'm agreeing with VC boyes but I [fully agree with Anish Acharya of A16Z](https://x.com/i/status/2008957804938428785):

The biggest barrier to AI adoption isn't cost or access. It's that people can't visualize what these tools can actually do. The default view among normies is still that you need to be a coder to use AI coding tools. This is plain wrong. As long as you can type English and have half a brain to describe your problem clearly, you can build tools to solve your problems.

A peasant in rural India can't conjure things to make his life easier. He still has to toil in the sun and break his back. But we cognitive peasants today have a personal genie at our disposal for just $20. All you have to do is rub the keyboard three times. Actually, you don't even have to do that anymore. You can just talk to it.
