Full agree with the last bit that Anish Acharya of A16Z is saying:

> the timeline is full of people using Claude Code to generate ads, recover corrupted video, make landing pages, manage business texts…  
>   
> the narrow view of coding agents is that they primarily decrease the cost of software development  
>   
> the ambitious view is that almost any problem/solution can be expressed in software and this capability is upstream of all knowledge work

In my view, there are two big reason why AI adoption has been slow among normal people.

1.  People are suffering from a crisis of imagination. They now have access to a magical genie and people are clueless as to what to wish for.
    
2.  A lot of people aren't giving themselves permission to experiment. They are hobbled by idiotic views of AI capabilities, self doubt, inertia, and fear.
    

The biggest problem is that people are unable to visualise the capabilities of these tools. This is in part due to the lack of experimentation and the part because many normies aren't yet using the ai coding tools. Until and unless they use these coding tools, it's hard to understand just how far AI has progressed.
