What will software look like in a world where it can be mass produced at industrial scale with the click of a few buttons?

[A good perspective by Chris Loy](https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/12/30/the-rise-of-industrial-software):

> Our appetite for AI slop is likely to be similarly insatiable. The adoption curve we’ve seen so far may pale beside what happens when disposable software production becomes truly mainstream. If the democratisation of software mirrors the impact of ubiquitous photo, video, and audio capture enabled by the smartphone, we may see user-generated software created, shared, and discarded at social-media scale. Should that happen, the feedback loops of novelty and reward will drive an explosion of software output that makes the past half-century of development look quaint by comparison.

There is a thriving and growing demand for healthy, sustainable production of foodstuffs, largely in response to the harmful effects of industrialisation. Is it possible that software might also resist mechanisation through the growth of an “organic software” movement? If we look at other sectors, we see that even those with the highest levels of industrialisation also still benefit from small-scale, human-led production as part of the spectrum of output.
