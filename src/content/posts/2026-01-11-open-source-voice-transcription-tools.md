I've been heavily using voice typing to write a lot of posts and it's been fun. This mode of writing helps me unlock a newer and more expressive voice. To be clear, I don't think this style of writing is a replacement for the regular style of writing but it's a different kind of writing.

I came across these free and open source tools on twitter that help with voice transcription.
