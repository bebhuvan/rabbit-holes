I'm fascinated with "advice" and what counts as good or bad advice. [Alex Imas said something interesting](https://x.com/alexolegimas/status/1988973118782861737?t=eZoYaMWyt3_Nbzjo068NIg&s=19) and I think I agree:

> This thread by Simon is spot on. Most advice is dumb—it’s too general to be useful—and I always tell my students I have no advice to give unless it’s very specific (eg run this analysis).  
> But “live over your skis” is good advice.
> 
> It means aim for more than what you think you can achieve.

The [quoted tweet from Simon](https://x.com/LaboratoryMinds/status/1988948578908402131?t=oyAdpFgOqdLSJWz1gQjOAA&s=19):

> Going through my mental Rolodex from 25 years of academia. The people who do great things were ridiculous tryhards, particularly early on.  
> Reaching further than they had a right to. As if something in their souls knew. If lucky, tutors and friends indulged this ultra cringe.
