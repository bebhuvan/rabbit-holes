Nathan Lambert on how we need to [change the way we work](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/get-good-at-agents?utm_campaign=email-half-post&r=1ds20&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) in the age of AI agents:
> Every engineer needs to learn how to design systems. Every researcher needs to learn how to run a lab. Agents push the humans up the org chart.
>
> I feel like I have an advantage by being early to this wave, but no longer feel like just working hard will be an lasting edge. When I can have multiple agents working productively in parallel on my projects, my role is shifting more to pointing the army rather than using the power-tool. Pointing the agents more effectively is far more useful than me spending a few more hours grinding on a problem.
