[Interesting take by Like Burgis. This is stuck in my mental craw for some reason](https://read.lukeburgis.com/p/spirit-and-the-cost-of-cognition?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5&triedRedirect=true):

> I would also now add a surprising element to my 2024 essay: as the cost of cognition approaches zero, that which is repeatable will be replaceable—and will indeed be replaced—by AI (a favorite saying of Palantir Co-Founder Stephen Cohen), which opens up an aperture for those who truly undertake creative acts. In short, we are going to be forced by the technology to be more creative; we will be impelled to do that which only the spirit can animate.

> Where there are dry bones, I see opportunity.

> Ezekiel saw a valley of dry bones; we see a civilization of dry souls. Yet the Spirit still breathes.  
> That which is most human—the religious sense, incarnational experiences (like liturgy, dancing, jazz), or the act of giving creative expression to that which we come into contact with in the world—all will take on more importance as AI fundamentally replaces many repeatable functions. Because of that, our time and energy is going to flow to that which gives the most meaning. We’re headed back to the oldest questions of existentialism—hopefully not the Sartrean variety, but that’s up to you and me.
