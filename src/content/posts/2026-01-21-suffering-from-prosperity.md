[Ryan Avent on the crisis of liberalism](https://ryanavent.substack.com/p/and-were-back?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5&triedRedirect=true):
> Just why the liberal world has found itself in crisis is a matter of active debate. There are voices on the right arguing that liberalism was never a particularly good idea in the first place: that people need to be ruled, or that true fulfillment only comes through celebration of god and tribe and tradition. As someone who very much enjoys thinking for himself and making his own choices I find these arguments unappealing at a gut level, but they also fail to reckon with liberalism’s overwhelming record of delivering the goods. **The world we seem determined to put behind us is the richest, most just, and most free that people have ever created, by miles and miles. Not free and just and rich enough! But we should allow ourselves to accept that with liberalism we really seem to be onto something.**
>
> This freedom and prosperity is profoundly good, it is worth remembering. It is good when people have enough to eat. It is good when people no longer have to worry about dying from diseases that claimed their ancestors. It is good to have access to more knowledge and art and opportunity. Liberalism’s victories are not empty ones! No god worth worshipping would demand that we give them up.
