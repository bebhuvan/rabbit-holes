[Generative AI is sexy, but predictive AI is useful.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/15/1129179/generative-ai-hype-distracts-us-from-ais-more-important-breakthroughs/)

> To get a sense of the immense progress on predictive AI and its future potential, we can look at the trajectory of the past 20 years. In 2005, we couldn’t get AI to tell the difference between a person and a pencil. By 2013, AI still couldn’t reliably detect a bird in a photo, and the difference between a pedestrian and a Coke bottle was massively confounding (this is how I learned that bottles do kind of look like people, if people had no heads). The thought of deploying these systems in the real world was the stuff of science fiction.

> Yet over the past 10 years, predictive AI has not only nailed bird detection down to the specific species; it has rapidly improved life-critical medical services like identifying problematic lesions and heart arrhythmia. Because of this technology, seismologists can predict earthquakes and meteorologists can predict flooding more reliably than ever before. Accuracy has skyrocketed for consumer-facing tech that detects and classifies everything from what song you’re thinking of when you hum a tune to which objects to avoid while you’re driving—making self-driving cars a reality.

> In the very near future, we should be able to accurately detect tumors and forecast hurricanes long before they can hurt anyone, realizing the lifelong hopes of people all over the world. That might not be as flashy as generating your own Studio Ghibli–ish film, but it’s definitely hype-worthy.
