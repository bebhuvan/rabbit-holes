There two stunning things in this tweet:

1.  I use Claude Code heavily and it's bloody amazing. That it can help a non-technical person like me to turn my ideal into reality still shatters my mind everyday, even after using Claude Code on an almost daily basis for over a year. It's magic! I can't believe it was a side project 🥲
    
2.  Claude Code was almost built by Claude Code itself! Bloody hell. Read that again. Also, unless you've used Claude Code, you won't realise why this is awesome.
    

> When I created Claude Code as a side project back in September 2024, I had no idea it would grow to be what it is today. It is humbling to see how Claude Code has become a core dev tool for so many engineers, how enthusiastic the community is, and how people are using it for all sorts of things from coding, to devops, to research, to non-technical use cases. This technology is alien and magical, and it makes it so much easier for people to build and create. Increasingly, code is no longer the bottleneck.

> A year ago, Claude struggled to generate bash commands without escaping issues. It worked for seconds or minutes at a time. We saw early signs that it may become broadly useful for coding one day.
> 
> Fast forward to today. In the last thirty days, I landed 259 PRs -- 497 commits, 40k lines added, 38k lines removed. Every single line was written by Claude Code + Opus 4.5. Claude consistently runs for minutes, hours, and days at a time (using Stop hooks). Software engineering is changing, and we are entering a new period in coding history. And we're still just getting started..

This is proof that a lot of things in life are the result of weird, wacky, and wild experimentation. A lot of things can't be planned and are just accidental progeny of your thoughts having wild and furious sex. Using intellectual contraception is a terrible idea. Let your thoughts engage in unrestrained bacchanalia and something wonderful might happen.
