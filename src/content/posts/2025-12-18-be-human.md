Hmm 🤔

> Humans should remain smarter than their refrigerators. It is insane that we are living in a time in which people are trying to make refrigerators smarter, but are satisfied to dumb down themselves and those around them. All the evidence suggests that AI is bad for your brain. If you use it as a salve for social and romantic frustration, it also makes it harder for you to connect with others and less resilient in the face of real life. If you let AI create more distance between you and words and language, you are allowing it to threaten some of the most important distinctions between humans and animals.

> AI is sold to us on the premise that it can offer us life on easy mode. No such mode exists. Life is for living, not escaping. Be human. Read human.
