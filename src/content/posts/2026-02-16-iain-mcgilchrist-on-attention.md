[Beautiful meditation](https://www.themarginalian.org/2026/02/15/iain-mcgilchrist-the-matter-with-things/) on attention:

> McGilchrist considers the way our attention constructs our reality and becomes the beating heart with which we love the world:  
>   
> The whole illuminates the parts as much as the parts can illuminate the whole… The world we experience — which is the only one we can know — is affected by the kind of attention we pay to it.  
>   
> Defining attention as “the manner in which our consciousness is disposed towards whatever else exists,” he writes:  
>   
> The choice we make of how we dispose our consciousness is the ultimate creative act: it renders the world what it is. It is, therefore, a moral act: it has consequences.
