Salvatore Sanfilippo on the distinction between vibe coding and "[automatic programming](https://antirez.com/news/159)":
> I'm a programmer, and I use automatic programming. The code I generate in this way is mine. My code, my output, my production. I, and you, can be proud.
> 
> If you are not completely convinced, think to Redis. In Redis there is not much technical novelty, especially at its start it was just a sum of basic data structures and networking code that every competent system programmer could write. So, why it became a very useful piece of software? Because of the ideas and visions it contained.

Programming is now automatic, vision is not (yet).
