What a [beautiful line](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) from Albert Camus

> In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.

This line is from his essay [Return to Tipasa:](https://genius.com/Albert-camus-return-to-tipasa-annotated)

> At noon on the half-sandy slopes covered with heliotropes like a foam left by the furious waves of the last few days as they withdrew, I watched the sea barely swelling at that hour with an exhausted motion, and I satisfied the two thirsts one cannot long neglect without drying up--I mean loving and admiring. For there is merely bad luck in not being loved; there is misfortune in not loving. All of us, today, are dying of this misfortune. For violence and hatred dry up the heart itself; the long fight for justice exhausts the love that nevertheless gave birth to it. In the clamor in which we live, love is impossible and justice does not suffice. This is why Europe hates daylight and is only able to set injustice up against injustice. But in order to keep justice from shriveling up like a beautiful orange fruit containing nothing but a bitter, dry pulp, I discovered once more at Tipasa that one must keep intact in oneself a freshness, a cool wellspring of joy, love the day that escapes injustice, and return to combat having won that light. Here I recaptured the former beauty, a young sky, and I measured my luck, realizing at last that in the worst years of our madness the memory of that sky had never left me. This was what in the end had kept me from despairing. I had always known that the ruins of Tipasa were younger than our new constructions or our bomb damage. There the world began over again every day in an ever new light. O light! This is the cry of all the characters of ancient drama brought face to face with their fate. This last resort was ours, too, and I knew it now. In the middle of winter I at last discovered that there was in me an invincible summer.

An extended version of this quote is [misattributed](https://substack.com/@nantepper/note/c-164795979?r=1eft5) to Camus but this line is from him. Even though Camus didn't write this entire thing it's still beautiful.

> My dear,  
> In the midst of hate, I found there was, within me, an invincible love.  
> In the midst of tears, I found there was, within me, an invincible smile.  
> In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm.  
> I realized, through it all, that…  
> In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.  
> And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back.  
>   
> Truly yours,
