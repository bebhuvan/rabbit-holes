What a [beautiful line](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) from Albert Camus

> In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.

An extended version of this quote is [misattributed](https://substack.com/@nantepper/note/c-164795979?r=1eft5) to Camus but this line is from him.
