What a [beautiful line](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) from Albert Camus

> In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.

An extended version of this quote is [misattributed](https://substack.com/@nantepper/note/c-164795979?r=1eft5) to Camus but this line is from him. Even though Camus didn't write this entire thing it's still beautiful.

> My dear,  
> In the midst of hate, I found there was, within me, an invincible love.  
> In the midst of tears, I found there was, within me, an invincible smile.  
> In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm.  
> I realized, through it all, that…  
> In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.  
> And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back.  
>   
> Truly yours,  
> Albert Camus”
