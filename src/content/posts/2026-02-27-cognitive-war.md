The backlash against social media is gaining ground. I wouldn't be surprised if there are widespread bans across the world in some shape or form in the next couple of years. 

An [interesting take](https://x.com/i/status/2026962396884107294) on the issue:

> China knows exactly what this does. Their domestic version of TikTok caps kids under 14 at 40 minutes a day, locks access between 6am and 10pm, and swaps the entire feed to educational content. Science, history, museums.
> 
> The version they export to everyone else? Unlimited, unrestricted, pure dopamine on demand.
> 
> When kids in the US and China were asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, the number one answer in America was influencer. In China it was astronaut.
> 
Macron calls this a cognitive war. Export what dulls young minds and keep what makes them intelligent for your own population.
> 
> This is the most effective weapon ever deployed against a generation’s ability to think.
