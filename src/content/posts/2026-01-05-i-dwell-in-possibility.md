Oooh, what a delightful collection of verse. Emily Dickinson is a goddamn genius. Sooo good.

> I DWELL in Possibility  
> A fairer house than Prose,  
> More numerous of windows,  
> Superior of doors.  
>   
> Of chambers, as the cedars—  
> Impregnable of eye;  
> And for an everlasting roof  
> The gables of the sky.  
>   
> Of visitors—the fairest—  
> For occupation—this—  
> The spreading wide my narrow hands  
> To gather Paradise.
