[We have genies in our pockets, just make a wish](https://x.com/i/status/2010855227940057101):

> I was interpreting an odd statutory investment limitation today and got stuck (no guidance anywhere). Asked GPT-5.2 Pro to find examples of companies that have ever exceeded this investment limitation (which would disprove the contrary interpretation).  
>   
> GPT-5.2 Pro proceeded to trawl the internet for random places where financial statements of these regulated entities are available (there is no central database). Analyzed a whole bunch of these financial statements (each is 100 pages+), including working line by line for specific types of investments I was interested in. Found the company's overall assets and calculated the ratio of each investment to total assets. Came back to me with specific examples and calculations of several different examples, showing that my interpretation of the statute was correct. The entire process took ~25 minutes.
