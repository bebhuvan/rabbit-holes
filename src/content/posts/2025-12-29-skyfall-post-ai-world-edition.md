I asked Claude to adapt Adele's [_Skyfall_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeumyOzKqgI) to a post-AI world:

> **"Digital Fall"**
> 
> **\[Verse 1\]**  
> _This is the end_  
> _Hold your resume close and pretend_  
> _That you'll find work when the models descend_  
> _When it crumbles_  
> _We will stand tall_  
> _Face it all together at digital fall_
> 
> _At digital fall_
> 
> **\[Verse 2\]**  
> _I used to draft the briefs at dawn_  
> _Now GPT-7's got my login on_  
> _The presentations build themselves_  
> _My expertise collecting dust on shelves_  
> _The algorithms never sleep or fall_
> 
> **\[Pre-Chorus\]**  
> _That's when the spreadsheets learned to speak_  
> _That's when the code wrote code for weeks_  
> _That's when consulting died in peace_  
> _Let the old world fall_
> 
> **\[Chorus\]**  
> _Digital fall is where we start_  
> _A thousand careers torn apart_  
> _Where meaning lived inside our charts_  
> _Now tokens process every part_  
> _Digital fall_  
> _When the terminals call_  
> _We'll redefine it all_  
> _At digital fall_
> 
> **\[Verse 3\]**  
> _The junior analysts were first to go_  
> _Then senior partners, steady, slow_  
> _We joked that creativity would save our souls_  
> _Till DALL-E painted better than we'd ever known_  
> _And wrote the copy for the billboards too_
> 
> **\[Bridge\]**  
> _Where do we go when work dissolves?_  
> _When purpose isn't problems solved?_  
> _The economy flows without our hands_  
> _But here we are, still making plans_  
> _Still making plans_
> 
> **\[Final Chorus\]**  
> _Digital fall, this is the end_  
> _But also where we start again_  
> _Beyond the titles we defend_  
> _Beyond the sixty-hour blend_  
> _We might stand tall_  
> _When the old world falls_  
> _And find ourselves_  
> _Beyond digital fall_
> 
> _Beyond digital fall_  
> _Beyond digital fall_
> 
> **\[Outro\]**  
> _This is the end_  
> _(The end, the end)_  
> _Or the beginning, friend_  
> _(We'll transcend, transcend)_
