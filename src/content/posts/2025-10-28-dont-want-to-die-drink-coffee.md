[Coffee is a miracle drug](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/05/30/how-much-coffee-is-too-much?taid=69001ef639f8c800019847a2&utm_campaign=editorial-social&utm_content=discovery.content&utm_medium=social-media.content.np&utm_source=twitter):

> But these are not the only risks associated with drinking coffee. Many lace their cup with additives like milk, sugar, cream and syrup, chronic overconsumption of which can also cause harm. A study of over 46,000 adults published in the Journal of Nutrition in May is suggestive. The results showed that participants who drank between one and three cups of coffee per day were roughly 15 percent less likely to die during the next decade than those who consumed none. That said, the benefit vanished if they stirred more than around a teaspoon of cream or half a teaspoon of sugar into their drink.  
> To maximise the benefits, therefore, don’t overdo the cups and take it as black—and as bitter—as you like.
