[Wonderful reflection](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/12/27/why-i-write.html) on the many joys and rewards kd writing by Drew Breunig. Hard agree with everything, especially this one:

The second most common question I get about my writing is, “How do you motivate yourself to write?” This is the answer. There are so many drafts that live, dormant in my draft folder. So many times I start a piece and lose interest. And then: something will click and I’ll draft, investigate, and finish a piece in an hour (here’s two examples). These aren’t always the most substantive pieces, but they keep the practice going and the momentum up.
