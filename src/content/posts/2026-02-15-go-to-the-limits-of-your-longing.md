I woke up and began my doomscrolling session on Substack and came across a note by [the awesome Cate Hall](https://substack.com/@usefulfictions/note/c-214648890?utm_source=notes-share-action&r=1eft5) with a screenshot of Rilke's 'Go to the Limits of Your Longing' poem.
[The translation](https://onbeing.org/poetry/go-to-the-limits-of-your-longing/) is under copyright but out of curiosity I asked Gemini and Claude to find the [original German version](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24288) and then translate it: 

> *God speaks to each of us before our making,* *then walks in silence as the night is breaking.* *But the words spoken before we each begin—* *these words, like silver, are these:*
> 
> *You, sent out beyond your own senses,* *go to the edge of your longing;* *clothe me.*
>
> *Grow like a fire behind all things,* *so that their shadows, stretched wide,* *may always cover me entirely.*
> 
> *Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.* *One must only keep going: no feeling is the furthest.* *Do not let yourself be severed from me.*
> 
> *Nearby is the land* *that they call life.* *You will recognize it* *by its gravity.*
> 
> *Give me your hand.*

I know it’s become trivial to use AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini, but the fact that I can ask a tool to find a German poem, translate it into English, and then help me understand it—all from my phone—is still kind of crazy.
