[Interesting post by Peter Steinberger on coding in the age of LLMs:](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/shipping-at-inference-speed)

> It’s incredible how far “vibe coding” has come this year. Whereas in ~May I was amazed that _some_ prompts produced code that worked out of the box, **this is now my expectation**. I can ship code now at a speed that seems unreal. I burned [a lot of tokens](https://x.com/thsottiaux/status/2004789121492156583) since then. Time for an update.

> It’s funny how these agents work. There’s been this argument a few weeks ago that [one needs to write code in order to feel bad architecture](https://x.com/steipete/status/1997380251081490717) and that using agents creates a disconnection - and I **couldn’t disagree more**. When you spend enough time with agents, you know exactly how long sth should take, and when codex comes back and hasn’t solved it in one shot, I already get suspicious.

> The amount of software I can create is now mostly **limited by inference time and hard thinking**. And let’s be honest - most software does not require hard thinking. Most apps shove data from one form to another, maybe store it somewhere, and then show it to the user in some way or another. The simplest form is text, so by default, whatever I wanna build, it starts as CLI. Agents can call it directly and verify output - closing the loop.
