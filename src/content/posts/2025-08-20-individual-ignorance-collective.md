I've often wondered what's the cost of individual apathy and cowardice about the state of the world. That is to say what happens if we ignore all the stupidity and the evils unfolding around us and what's our duty to ourselves and our fellow people. What can an individual do?

[Branko Milanovic](https://open.substack.com/pub/branko2f7/p/a-view-of-the-world?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5) asking the same question:

> That led me to the following question. I avoided unpleasant conversations with people who absolutely did not care nor know anything about world affairs, and I had uncomfortable discussions with those who cared; what was better? For me personally, it was better to avoid unpleasant topics. But was it good for the world—and was it even pleasing to myself who from Titoist Yugoslavia inherited a huge interest in world affairs—to just ignore whatever is happening in the world? I could have a pleasant time with people who ignored anything of history and of present-day politics, or unpleasant time with people who read or knew something about both. Between the two, I thought, I opted for the latter. Surely, I appreciated as individuals more people who disagreed with me than those who were totally indifferent.
