[Sundar Sarukkai on what a good translation is:](https://scroll.in/article/1090200/bride-in-the-hills-how-vanamala-viswanathas-new-translation-thinks-beyond-linguistic-gaps)
>Translation is the act of removing that ladder and replacing it with another ladder, replacing one language with another. In this view, a successful translation can be seen as one that is able to produce the experiences and imagination of the original novel. If this is the aim and consequence of reading, questions of equivalence and felicity are not as significant as it is made out to be by many translators.
> 
> A good translation is not about the felicity in one or more languages but rather the capacity to produce spaces of imagination from one language and reproduce/recreate it in another language. The movement from one language to another in the act of translation is always mediated and grounded in the imagination of the translator. A good translator of fiction reproduces imagination, not meanings, not words and structure. Does the translator have the capacity to enter and recreate the world in the imagination of the author? That is the real question. And I think this is really what Viswanatha succeeds so well in doing.
