What will the post-AI future look like? Here are four scenarios [outlined by Allison Schrager](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2026-01-27/claude-cowork-ai-can-t-pay-for-your-retirement):

> AI can ruin your Hinge date. It can detect cosmic anomalies. It can make history come alive. But it cannot suspend the basic laws of economics, says Allison Schrager. Elon Musk’s recent prediction — that AI will make saving for retirement unnecessary — is complete hogwash in her eyes. Consider the following four scenarios. In the future, Allison says AI will either …
> 
> 1.Make us more productive in the same way that railroads, the telegraph and electricity did in the past.
> 
> 2.Transform our lives in a completely novel way by speeding up and possibly even spurring innovation.
> 
> 3.Become a useful tool that won’t boost productivity very much right away, but will disrupt society like the internet.
> 
> 4.Kill us all.
> 
> OK, fine. I guess if No. 4 happens, you won’t be needing a 401(k). But Allison, who is bullish on the future of AI, says such apocalyptic forecasts are highly unlikely.
