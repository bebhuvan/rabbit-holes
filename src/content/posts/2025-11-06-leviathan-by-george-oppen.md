I came across George Oppen [in this article](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n12/ben-lerner/diary), and a random Google l[ed me to this poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53221/leviathan-56d2325279712), and the only word that can succinctly capture my reaction is "dayum!"

> Truth also is the pursuit of it:
> 
> Like happiness, and it will not stand.
> 
> Even the verse begins to eat away
> 
> In the acid. Pursuit, pursuit;
> 
> A wind moves a little,
> 
> Moving in a circle, very cold.
> 
> How shall we say?
> 
> In ordinary discourse—
> 
> We must talk now. I am no longer sure of the words,
> 
> The clockwork of the world. What is inexplicable
> 
> Is the ‘preponderance of objects.’ The sky lights
> 
> Daily with that predominance
> 
> And we have become the present.
> 
> We must talk now. Fear
> 
> Is fear. But we abandon one another.
