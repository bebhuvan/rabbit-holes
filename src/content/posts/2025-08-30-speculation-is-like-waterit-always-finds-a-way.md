description: "From a front-row seat in Indian markets, I trace how post-COVID
  tech and payments supercharged both investing and gambling. The essay makes a
  simple case: bans without internet, payments, platform, and cross-border
  enforcement just move the problem. Better to design the dam—keep play on
  regulated rails and cut harm."

[In this post, I argue that speculation is like water](https://open.substack.com/pub/bhuvan/p/speculation-is-like-waterit-always?r=1eft5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true)—it never stops, it just finds new channels. Using India’s gaming ban and global examples, I show why prohibition shrinks what’s visible but pushes play offshore or underground, and why channelisation with smart, coordinated regulation works better.
