> The lesson to take from Nietzsche is that we _all_ may not fully understand the implications of our most cherished values, our personal beliefs, or actions, and live our entire lives in ignorance or self-denial, unconsciously undermining ourselves and others.
> 
> How do we avoid this?
> 
> We need to make sure that the belief systems we occupy, and the values we deeply attach ourselves to, are _actually serving us and those around us_.
> 
> We need to make sure that everything we believe is not simply being used to serve someone else’s interests, to dampen our minds, and to keep us under control.
> 
> Can we ever be sure of anything? How do we know when we have taken enough care?
> 
> The harsh truth is that we must _always_ continue to think, explore, and question so long as we live.
> 
> This is the burden (and joy) of being a free being.
> 
> We must never rest content placing our freedom into rigid traditions, or pre-made generic belief systems.
> 
> Is this too much to ask? Is this too much of a burden to place on people?
> 
> Not if you care about _freedom_.
> 
> _Freedom is the heaviest of burdens for a human being._
> 
> I want to be clear, I am not saying that everyone should become philosophers, if by that someone means dedicating their life to studying, writing, and thinking about academic philosophy.
> 
> That is silly and naive.
> 
> But I do think that everyone should _dedicate at least some meaningful portion of their lives to critical self-examination and self-creation_.
> 
> The reality is that we live in a world where self-inquiry, self-examination, and self-creation are simply _too inconvenient_ to be done.
