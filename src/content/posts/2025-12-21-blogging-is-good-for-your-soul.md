[Amen. I couldn't agree more](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/).

Having a blog online and writing regular has led to more good things than anything else in my life. It's not only a good way to force yourself to learn things and to write better but it's the best way to discover new, weird and wonderful rabbit holes to go tumbling down.

All my vibe coding experiments, in one way or another have been the result of me having a blog. A blog is a momentum machine--it'll always guarantee something new. It could ne discovering new things, new ways to frame things, new ways to understand things and perhaps most importantly new things to do.

While there's always an urge to be performative with one's blog and to seek attention, there's an immense amount of fun to be had if you can resist that urge.

I discovered the post I've quoted above [from a link in this post about link blogging](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/), which is what this blog is.
