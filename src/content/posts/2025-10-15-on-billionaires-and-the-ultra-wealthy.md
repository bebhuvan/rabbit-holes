[Interesting polemic on billionaires and the ultra-wealthy:](https://astridsabihalloyd.substack.com/p/hollow-kings)

> The Hollow King, wired for insatiability, cannot pause. Acceleration itself has become a drug. Sufficiency is inconceivable. Each breakthrough is only a threshold toward the next. Competition becomes an arms race: if I don’t do it, someone else will. **This logic justifies dragging the entire species into irreversible experiments. And all of it is underwritten by a messianic ego, the conviction that they alone were chosen to lead humanity.** These qualities are the exact opposite of what stewardship requires. History shows us what happens when rulers governed by pathology wield transformative tools. Nero’s insecurities lit Rome on fire. The dynastic obsessions of the Habsburgs fractured Europe for generations. Our version of this story is billionaires with god complexes accelerating technologies to enact their transhumanist visions that are unravelling civilization itself.

> The Hollow King cannot stop. They are neurologically and culturally wired for expansion without limit. When such a pathology controls technologies that shape the future of life itself, the stakes are existential. And when proximity warps others into complicity, the danger spreads like fire. **If we continue to orbit them, their sickness will become our own. The Hollow Kings will not save us. Their pathology is not a private tragedy; it is a civilizational contagion.**
