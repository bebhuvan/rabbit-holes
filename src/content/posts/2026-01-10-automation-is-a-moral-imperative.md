[Nabeel Qureshi on automation](https://x.com/i/status/2009772821589692456):

> Anything that can be automated should be. There’s no good reason humans should be making excel models or powerpoints in 10 years, any more than they should be hand-washing clothes. It’s toil and drudgery.
> 
> What will remain? Anything we want to do because it’s fun or interesting.
> 
> May be weird but I view automation as a moral imperative so that everybody can spend their time gardening or making art or playing chess or making games or hanging with their family or whatever else they want to do.
> 
> Any angst around job automation just feels like parochialism to me. Like abacus users getting sad that somebody invented the calculator or scribes getting sad that we invented typesetting. Zoom out, we have better things to do with our time!

From the quote tweets.

[Will Manidis](https://x.com/i/status/2009776401000313061):

> We automated basically all needs 50 years ago. The jobs have been pretend ever since but we love our fake jobs.
> 
> Every AI fear about automation is something that already happened
> 
> The only real jobs are trucking, farming, building shelter, and going to war. most of these are illegal to do in America today. the rest of the economy is just shining financialization

[Rohit Krishnan shared one of his articles](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/what-we-want-is-a-hunter-gatherer):

> Whichever vision of the past glory that you’re most partial to, it stems from the yearning for a time when life used to be understandable, when proving oneself wasn’t a constant struggle, when you could just do the thing instead of proving you can do the thing, when the egregore of our society wasn’t turned into the mechanistic mode of analysing our aptitudes, in short when things were more personal.

> We won’t live in small villages with cobbled streets en masse anymore because we need the giant glass skyscrapers and the congealed intellect of our multi billion population to move ahead, but that doesn’t mean we can’t recreate what made those cobbled streets seem interesting in the first place. That’s the true retvrn.
