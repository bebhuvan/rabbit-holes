[Leila Clark on the hype around AI coding](https://approachwithalacrity.substack.com/p/claude-is-not-a-senior-engineer-yet?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&shareImageVariant=overlay&r=1eft5&triedRedirect=true):

> Since Claude can’t create the good abstractions. Claude’s powers are limited by how good the blocks you give it are. Have no illusions; Claude cannot reproduce Sentry and Terraform and Playwright. These are incredibly complex and well-designed pieces of code. And since Claude can’t create good abstractions on its own, there’s a limit to how much anyone can do with Claude alone. Even though everyone on X thinks you can vibe-code all software, I think the opposite is true: the value of good abstractions and well-designed infrastructure has never been higher.

> If I had to boil down my criticism of Claude to one sentence, it’s this: Claude doesn’t have a soul. It doesn’t want anything. It certainly doesn’t yearn to create beautiful things. So it doesn’t produce good solutions. It doesn’t write elegant abstractions where there were none; it doesn’t manicure the code garden.
