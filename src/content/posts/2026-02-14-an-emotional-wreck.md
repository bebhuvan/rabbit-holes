This interview of Daniel Radcliffe is wonderful. It reminded me of this line that's been rattling in my head: "We're all stumbling and suffering through life on how to live life.”

>  **You’ve described Every Brilliant Thing, where your character makes a list of reasons to live, as “a very funny play about depression.” What would be on your list?**
Most of mine at the moment would probably be about my son — all the bizarre pronunciations he has for things. I took him to [the live monster-truck show] Monster Jam, and there’s a truck that’s a unicorn, and it shoots confetti out of its horn. The truck is called Sparkle Smash, if you’re interested. I heard him telling that story later, and he referred to the confetti as “spaghetti.” Also, his godfather gave him a little toy-car model of a Lamborghini, which he has remembered as “zucchini.” So there’s any number of just incredibly sweet things that he says.

I’d also say the music of Joanna Newsom or Tom Lehrer. I could do a list of a thousand brilliant things that were just records. And there’s one in the show that I love, which is “Waking up late with someone you love.” That is a brilliant thing in life. 

> **What’s the best advice you’ve ever gotten?**
Something my dad said has always stuck with me. “When you’re meeting people, just get your hand out first.” I’ll go into a room full of a lot of people and will feel a deep need to shake everybody’s hand. As a kid, I was so aware of the stereotype around child stars. I was like, “Man, everyone thinks I’m going to be a dick everywhere I go. I just have to try and prove as quickly as possible to somebody that I’m not.” It’s a way to show that you’re not an asshole.
