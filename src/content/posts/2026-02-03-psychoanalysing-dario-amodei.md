I havent yet read Dario Amodei's recent essay but jumped straight to [this piece by John Herrman](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/dario-amodeis-warnings-about-ai-are-about-politics-too.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=s1&utm_campaign=nym) in which he reluctantly psychoanalyzes Dario:

> It’s sort of hard to know how to read a manifesto like this from one of the most powerful figures in tech. Is it a sober, strategic precursor to policy papers for the next administration? The highest-profile episode of AI psychosis yet? A lament about the problems of today written in the technological dialect of tomorrow? If you take out the AI, it reads like a social-democratic electoral platform full of reforms and normative expectations that an American progressive would find appealing, resembling a plea to treat the tech industry’s future wealth accumulation as something akin to a Nordic sovereign-wealth fund. It’s likewise legible as a series of arguments about things that “we” should have started addressing a long time ago, like wealth inequality — partially a consequence of mass automations past — or the gradual construction of a terrifying surveillance state within a nominal democracy, with the help of the last generation of big tech companies. Amodei’s shoulds are, to his credit, more honest than the vague gestures at UBI or hyperabundance you get from some of his peers, but that also means they’re available to scrutinize. To the extent you can pick up on fear in “Adolescence,” it doesn’t seem to revolve around terrorists using AI to build “mirror life” that might destroy the planet or the prospect of that “country of geniuses” taking charge, but rather the way things already are and have been heading for years.
