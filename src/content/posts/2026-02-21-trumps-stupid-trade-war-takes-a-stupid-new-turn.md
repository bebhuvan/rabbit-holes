The US Supreme Court says that Trump's tarrifs are illegal and Trump finds a new way impose the same tariffs. 

> The court’s 6-3 decision has significant implications for the U.S. economy, consumers and the president’s trade policy. The Trump administration had said that a loss at the Supreme Court could force the government to unwind trade deals with other countries and potentially pay hefty refunds to importers.
>
> Mr. Trump is the first president to claim that a 1970s emergency statute, which does not mention the word “tariffs,” allowed him to unilaterally impose the duties without congressional approval.
> 
> Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that statute does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.
> 
> “The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope.

> The justices were “fools and lapdogs” as well as “unpatriotic and disloyal”, Trump said at a hastily arranged press conference at the White House. The president alleged that they were “swayed by foreign interests” and said other countries were “dancing in the streets”.
> 
> “I’m ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country,” he said.

Oh and hes [doubling down](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-global-trade-tariff-supreme-court.html) on his stupid trade war:
> President Donald Trump on Friday evening said he signed an executive order imposing a new 10% “global tariff,” hours after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping “reciprocal” import duties in a major rebuke of his trade agenda.
> 
The “Section 122” tariffs will take effect “almost immediately,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.
