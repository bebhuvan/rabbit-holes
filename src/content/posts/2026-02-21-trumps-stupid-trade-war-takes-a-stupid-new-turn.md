The US Supreme Court says that Trump's tarrifs are illegal and Trump finds a new way impose the same tariffs. 

> The court’s 6-3 decision has significant implications for the U.S. economy, consumers and the president’s trade policy. The Trump administration had said that a loss at the Supreme Court could force the government to unwind trade deals with other countries and potentially pay hefty refunds to importers.
>
> Mr. Trump is the first president to claim that a 1970s emergency statute, which does not mention the word “tariffs,” allowed him to unilaterally impose the duties without congressional approval.
> 
> Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that statute does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.
> 
> “The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,” the chief justice wrote.

> The justices were “fools and lapdogs” as well as “unpatriotic and disloyal”, Trump said at a hastily arranged press conference at the White House. The president alleged that they were “swayed by foreign interests” and said other countries were “dancing in the streets”.
> 
> “I’m ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country,” he said.

Oh and hes [doubling down](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-global-trade-tariff-supreme-court.html) on his stupid trade war:
> President Donald Trump on Friday evening said he signed an executive order imposing a new 10% “global tariff,” hours after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping “reciprocal” import duties in a major rebuke of his trade agenda.
> 
The “Section 122” tariffs will take effect “almost immediately,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.

Trump has other options to continue the dumbest trade war in the history. They are somewhat bad but he can continue his stupidity unchecked. [Doug Irwin in The Economist](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2026/02/20/the-supreme-court-tariffs-ruling-reins-in-donald-trump):
> Although the broad discretionary and arbitrary scope of the IEEPA approach may be gone, many other cudgels remain. The president has ample authority under other statutes to rebuild the tariff wall, albeit with somewhat greater difficulty and many more holes.
> 
> Some of these statutes allow for across-the-board tariffs on all goods from all countries; Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for instance, allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days for balance-of-payments reasons. These are supposed to be non-discriminatory. Some are more narrowly targeted at particular countries engaged in unfair trade practices. Section 301 was used to impose tariffs against China in Mr Trump’s first term and could be brandished against other newly declared unfair traders. Some are aimed at stopping imports of specific goods from any country, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 on national-security grounds. These have already been deployed in the case of steel, aluminium, semiconductors and other products—and the Trump administration is looking to impose even more.
