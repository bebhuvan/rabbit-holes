[From this post that's overflowing with potential rabbit holes](https://open.substack.com/pub/thecuttingfloor/p/the-human-surplus?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5). Also pay attention to the beautiful framing of things-brilliant writing:

> Han Byung-Chul says that ritual is repetition without purpose, a way of founding community through shared uselessness. Performance seeks applause; ritual seeks duration. In the performance culture of the West, even grief must be productive, posted, monetised. In the ritual culture of the East, continuity is its own defence: the temple rebuilt, the porcelain recast, the festival repeated until memory becomes weather. Between them stands the modern remainderâ€”too connected to vanish, too surplus to command.
