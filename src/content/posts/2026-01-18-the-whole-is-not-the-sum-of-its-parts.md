[This feels intuitively right to me](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/16/opinion/neuroscience-thinking-human.html):

> But over the past several years the field of neuroscience seems to have moved away from this modular approach (each brain region has its own job). Researchers are more likely to believe that the brain is a network of interconnected regions. They are more likely to talk about vast and dynamic webs of neurons whose connections link disparate parts of the brain.  
>   
> Luiz Pessoa, who runs the Maryland Neuroimaging Center, recently offered a metaphor that helps a layman like me understand what’s going on. In an essay for Aeon, he asks us to imagine a flock of starlings swooping and swirling in the sky. No single starling organizes this ballet, yet out of the local interactions between all the starlings a coordinated dance emerges.  
>   
> As the brain is trying to navigate through the complex situations of the day, it is creating what Pessoa calls “neuronal ensembles distributed across multiple brain regions,” which, like a murmuration of starlings, “forms a single pattern from the collective behavior.”
