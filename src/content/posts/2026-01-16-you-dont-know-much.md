> The more deeply I read, the less I have to say.  
> It's funny how that works.
> 
> I notice that my own thoughts, my own experiences, even my own relationships aren't as uniquely interesting as I want them to be. I still value the life
> 
> I've built, but I recognize how much more it could be.  
> By reading deeply, I realize how much more interesting I could be.
> 
> That's worth passing on.
