[Interesting thoughts by Jesús Fernández-Villaverde:](https://x.com/JesusFerna7026)

> Mokyr has long argued that Europe’s Republic of Letters encouraged broad scientific and technological innovation by providing a setting where new ideas could be evaluated and disseminated. For him, Europe occupied the ideal midpoint between political fragmentation and cultural unity: enough polycentrism to prevent the suppression of ideas by heavy-handed rulers, but enough common ground to sustain serious dialogue and a deep pool of potential patrons and protectors. But what if, as Wang cautiously suggests, the institutions of an open society are no longer necessary for scientific and technological innovation? (To be fair, Wang does not assert this as fact—he only hints at it). Elaborating on Wang, one could construct the following argument:
>

> 
> ![2️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/32-20e3.svg) Yes, the institutions of an open society were necessary in the 19th and 20th centuries to create today’s framework of universities, academic societies, and scientific journals.
>

> 
> ![4️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/34-20e3.svg) Indeed, China possesses institutions such as Peking University and Tsinghua University, and it performs impressively in mathematics, engineering, and computer science—fields central to scientific and technological progress.

> 
> ![6️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/36-20e3.svg) By limiting the rise of anti-scientific movements—such as the “decolonize science” trend on many Western campuses—or by avoiding resource allocation to “useless” humanities, China might even gain a comparative advantage.
> 
> ![7️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/37-20e3.svg) The historical episodes of anti-science in totalitarian regimes (e.g., Deutsche Physik in Nazi Germany or Lysenkoism in the USSR) are not inevitable in a modern, technocratic Confucian state such as China’s, which prizes pragmatism.
> 
> ![8️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/38-20e3.svg) In fact, pragmatism might help China avoid some of the West’s current problems: the creeping politicization of the natural sciences, rising bureaucratization, and resource allocation driven more by lobbying than by scientific merit.

> In short, have science and technology grown so powerful and self-sustaining that they no longer depend on their historical institutional scaffolding?
