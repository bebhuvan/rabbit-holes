Beautiful.

> Take it easy, Sadness. Settle down.  
> You asked for evening. Now, it’s come. It’s here.  
> A choking fog has blanketed the town,  
> infecting some with calm, the rest with fear.  
>   
> While the squalid throng of mortals feels the sting  
> of heartless pleasure swinging its barbed knout  
> and finds remorse in slavish partying,  
> take my hand, Sorrow. I will lead you out,  
>   
> away from them. Look as the dead years lurch,  
> in tattered clothes, from heaven’s balconies.  
> From the depths, regret emerges with a grin.  
>   
> The spent sun passes out beneath an arch,  
> and, shroudlike, stretched from the antipodes,  
> —hear it, O hear, love!—soft night marches in.
