Ufff. What a poem. Each verse feels saturated with the bloody, neglected horrors of our own time — horrors I’m no doubt forcing into it, but can’t help seeing there

Couldn't stop hearing the echoes of the present.

> While loud the red-flecked mouths of cannons sing  
> And grapeshot whistles under empty sky;  
> While, red and green, before each preening King,  
> The massed battalions break, and thousands die;  
> While flowers bloom and sweet grass grows again,  
> In splendid sunshine, under summer heat,  
> And madness grinds a hundred thousand men  
> Into a steaming pile of rotting meat; . . .  
>   
> A God smiles down through incense-laden air  
> At chalices and altars, gold, ornate,  
> And slowly dozes off to mumbled prayer;  
> But wakes when black-clad mothers, bowed with grief  
> And weeping, clink into His silver plate  
> The few coins in a knotted handkerchief.
