## 🔧 Required Setup (IMPORTANT)

### ⚠️ Environment Variables Required
**Current State**: AI CMS requires environment variables to function
- **Issue**: Missing `CLAUDE_API_KEY` causes 401 errors
- **Impact**: AI enhancement and content refinement won't work

### 🔑 Required Environment Variables
Add these in **Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment Variables**:

1. **`CLAUDE_API_KEY`** (Required for AI features)
   - Get from: [Claude API Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - Format: `sk-ant-api03-...`
   - Used for: Content enhancement, refinement, suggestions

2. **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** (Required for publishing)
   - Get from: [GitHub Settings → Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Scope: `repo` (full control)
   - Used for: Publishing posts to repository

3. **`GITHUB_REPO`** (Required for publishing)
   - Format: `username/repository-name`
   - Example: `bebhuvan/rabbit-holes`
   - Used for: Target repository for published posts

### 📋 Quick Setup Steps
1. **Add environment variables** in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. **Wait for redeployment** (1-2 minutes)
3. **Test at `/cms`** - "Test Functions" button should work
4. **See `SETUP_GUIDE.md`** for detailed instructions

## 🔒 Security Consideration (To Address)

### ⚠️ CMS Public Access Issue
**Current State**: The `/cms` route is publicly accessible without authentication
- **Risk**: Anyone can visit `your-site.pages.dev/cms` and create/edit posts
- **Impact**: Potential unauthorized content creation

### 🛡️ Potential Solutions (Choose Later)
1. **Simple password protection** - Add JavaScript prompt to CMS page
2. **IP-based restriction** - Cloudflare WAF rule to block `/cms` except your IP
3. **Subdomain approach** - Move CMS to separate subdomain with access controls
4. **Remove public CMS** - Use only PagesCMS (GitHub-secured) for public deployment
5. **Proper authentication** - Implement OAuth or session-based auth

### 📋 Recommendation
For immediate security: Consider removing `/cms` from production build and rely on PagesCMS (GitHub-authenticated) for content management until proper authentication is implemented.
