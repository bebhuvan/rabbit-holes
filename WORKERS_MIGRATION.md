# 🔄 Cloudflare Pages to Workers Migration Guide

This project has been migrated from Cloudflare Pages to Cloudflare Workers following Cloudflare's recommendation to consolidate on Workers for future development.

## 🎯 Migration Summary

**Before (Pages):**
- Static site hosted on Cloudflare Pages
- Functions in `/functions/` directory
- Deployment via Pages dashboard or GitHub integration

**After (Workers):**
- Static assets served via Workers Static Assets
- API routes handled by Workers
- Functions moved to `/src/api/` directory
- Enhanced configuration and development workflow

## 📁 File Structure Changes

```
Old (Pages):                    New (Workers):
functions/                      src/

                                    ├── test-simple.js
wrangler.toml (Pages config)        └── test.js
                                
                                wrangler.toml (Workers config)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Updates

### Environment Variables Migration

**Set these via Wrangler CLI:**
```bash
# Required API keys
wrangler secret put CLAUDE_API_KEY
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
wrangler secret put GITHUB_REPO
wrangler secret put CMS_PASSWORD
```

### Domain Configuration

Update your domain settings in the Cloudflare Workers dashboard:
1. Go to Workers & Pages → rabbit-holes → Settings → Triggers
2. Add your custom domain routes
3. Update DNS records to point to Workers

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

```bash
# Development (local)
npm run workers:dev

# Deploy to staging
npm run workers:deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run workers:deploy
```

## 🔄 API Endpoint Changes

All API endpoints remain the same:
- `/auth` - CMS authentication
- `/enhance` - AI content enhancement
- `/metadata` - Link metadata fetching
- `/publish` - GitHub publishing
- `/refine` - Content refinement
- `/test-simple` - Basic API test
- `/test` - Comprehensive API test

## ✅ Benefits of Migration

1. **Future-Proof**: All Cloudflare's future investment is in Workers
2. **Better Performance**: Enhanced static asset serving
3. **More Features**: Access to latest Workers capabilities
4. **Unified Platform**: Single platform for frontend and backend
5. **Enhanced Security**: Better security controls and headers

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Start Astro development server
npm run dev

# Start Workers development server (for API testing)
npm run workers:dev
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build static assets
npm run build

# Deploy to Workers
npm run workers:deploy
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Static Assets**: Now served via Workers Static Assets (automatic optimization)
2. **API Routes**: Maintained compatibility - no frontend changes needed
3. **Environment Variables**: Must be set via `wrangler secret put` command
4. **Custom Domains**: Need to be reconfigured in Workers dashboard
5. **Analytics**: Now uses Workers Analytics Engine

## 🔍 Testing Migration

1. **API Test**: Visit `/test-simple` to verify Workers are responding
2. **CMS Test**: Test the `/cms` interface functionality
3. **Publishing Test**: Try creating and publishing a post
4. **Static Assets**: Verify all pages, images, and styles load correctly

## 📞 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **API Keys**: Ensure all secrets are set via `wrangler secret put`
- **Domain Issues**: Verify DNS and Workers routes configuration  
- **Build Errors**: Check `wrangler.toml` syntax and build commands
- **Static Assets**: Verify `dist/` directory exists after build

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check Workers logs
wrangler tail

# Verify configuration
wrangler whoami
wrangler kv:namespace list
```

## 🎉 Migration Complete!

Your blog is now running on Cloudflare Workers with enhanced performance and future-proof architecture. All existing functionality is preserved while gaining access to Cloudflare's latest platform features.
